%Introduction

Describe our view of the challenges and breakthroughs in the call.

Systems engineers are currently given few
development tools to help answer basic questions about
potential cyber vulnerabilities and how to  mitigate them.  Typically, they must rely on
process-oriented checklists and guidelines. Cyber vulnerabilities
are often discovered during penetration testing late in the
development process; or worse yet, they may be discovered
only after the product has been fielded, necessitating extremely
expensive and time-consuming remediation. This is not a
sustainable development model.

Fortunately, formal methods 
(define?)
has advanced to the point that new tools and techniques can 
be used to address cybersecurity and cyber-resiliency design challenges.  

Our application domain is avionics and aerospace systems in general.  
Our team has developed a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) 
envirnoment that 

scale to real aerospace systems

Ability to rapidly co-evolve systems and associated evidence; and
Ease of use for non-expert developers and evaluators.

 - Applications to specific major systems in government and industry;
 - Tour-de-force results, such as proofs of significant mathematical results or reasoning about modern processors;
 - Advancement of FM ecosystems surrounding the various provers and stacks; and
