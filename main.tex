\begin{abstract}
Abstract text goes here. This single paragraph ($\le$50 words) summarizes the significant aspects of the manuscript. Often it indicates whether the manuscript is a report of new work, a review or overview, or a combination of thereof. Do not cite references in the abstract. Papers must not have been published previously, must fit into the theme of an open Call for Papers, and must be targeted toward the general technical reader.
