Formal methods tools providing mathematical proof of system properties have
improved dramatically in power and capability. We have developed a model-based
systems engineering environment integrating formal methods at all levels of system design.
Our tools enable systems engineers to address cybersecurity concerns early
in the development of complex high-assurance systems.
