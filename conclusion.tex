We have produced a model-based systems engineering environment
called BriefCASE, based on the Architecture Analysis and Design
Language.  The BriefCASE tools and methodology provide design, analysis, and code
generation capabilities based on formal methods and targeted at
high-assurance cyberphysical systems.  

Key innovations include automated architectural design patterns 
for cyber-resiliency, co-evolution of system design and assurance 
artifacts (captured as an assurance case linked to the architecture model), 
synthesis of code for high-assurance components, and code generation
targeting the formally verified seL4 microkernel.  

We have demonstrated the effectiveness and scalability of these 
tools by using them to add new cyber-resilient features to a military 
helicopter avionics system.  Their successful use by our product engineers 
provides evidence that formal methods can be incorporated into 
industrial projects.  

All of the tools are open-source, with links and documentation available
at \url{http://loonwerks.com/projects/case.html}.  We hope that others 
will find value in this approach and extend the tools with new cyber transforms, 
expanded system analysis tools, and code generation for additional operating 
systems and computing platforms.  







%BriefCASE provides
%access to two cyber requirements analysis tools (GearCASE
%and DCRYPPS) that can examine AADL models to detect potential
%cyber vulnerabilities and suggest requirements for mitigation.
%A library of architectural transforms guides systems engineers
%through automated model transformations that modify the
%architecture to address these requirements, oftentimes inserting new
%high-assurance components synthesized from formal
%specifications using the SPLAT tool. Formal verification that the
%transformed system model satisfies its cyber requirements is accomplished
%via model checking using the Assume Guarantee Reasoning
%Environment (AGREE). Cyber-resilient code implementing the
%verified model is automatically generated using the HAMR
%tool. If desired, this code can be targeted to the formally
%verified seL4 secure microkernel.  Another novel aspect of our approach is
%the use of an assurance argument embedded in the architecture model
%itself to capture and document the design decisions made during this
%process, along with associated rationale.
%
%We have successfully demonstrated our BriefCASE methodology and tools on the
%CH-47F helicopter Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS), utilizing a team of CAAS
%development engineers who had no previous experience with formal methods.  We
%are currently incorporating lessons learned from this experience to improve the BriefCASE
%methodology and tools, focusing on scalability and usability.
